# PEMDASCalculator

# Overview

The app that I have created here is called the 'PEMDAS' calculator. PEMDAS stands for Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication,
Divison, Addition, and Subtractions. These are all necessary for a typical calculator.

My purpose for creating this app was to learn a language and to be able to create my first app. Now I look forward to any given
opportunity in which I can create apps for friends, family, a business, or for a fun game.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
